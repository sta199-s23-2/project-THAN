### Data Introduction:

This data comes from the Tidy Tuesday repositories on GitHub via the site "Data is Plural." It comes from Lynn Fisher who collected data from upwards of 630 movies, calculating the difference between the love interests' ages. This was collected and published on February 7th, 2018. The data set explores the age difference between couples in Hollywood movies which demonstrates the male-female power dynamic in the movie industry. Observations of the data set list the movie name, director, release year, and then the age difference before having columns for what number couple each one is (only matters if there are multiple in the movie), their names, their characters' names, their birth dates, and then their ages.

### Research Question:

Does the age difference of actors in movies decrease as the release date becomes more modern?

Our research will provide concrete data on whether the uncomfortable age gaps between male and female romantic interests in movies has actually been waning over time. This will tell us if criticism within the industry and from viewers has actually been effective in making a change in this issue.

2.  Methodology

We will aim to answer our research question first by removing outlying data points, like including same-sex couples, from the dataset. Given that there is not a long history of same-sex couples in film, it would be difficult to use these observations without skewing the data.

3.  Results

```{r}
#| label: age-gap-point

AgeGaps <- AgeGaps |>
  mutate(older_partner = if_else(actor_1_age > actor_2_age, character_1_gender, character_2_gender))

AgeGaps |>
  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = age_difference, color = older_partner)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("woman" = "pink", "man" = "skyblue"))
