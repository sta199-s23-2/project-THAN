However, one per data set is required.)\n\nHow does a player's nationality and club team, correlate to their current rating and potential?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nI find it very intriguing to explore how a player’s nationality and club team affects their current rating and potential. For example, do some teams have player’s with low ratings but a very high potential rating in the future, and do some teams primarily have players with no potential room to grow? Also do certain countries have higher rated players than other countries, or do they have players with a larger amount of potential to improve? I hypothesize that the largest teams like Real Madrid or Barcelona will have players with a higher rating but no significantly greater potential growth. While smaller teams with a developmental academy like Ajax or Lisbon will have players with a lower rating but a higher level of potential growth.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nNationality: Categorical\nClub team: Categorical\nRating: Quantitative\nPotential: Quantitative"

The article explains the concept of potential as a measure of a player’s maximum possible rating in the future, based on their current attributes and age. The article also covers the different types of potential ratings and how they are calculated, including fixed potential, range potential, and dynamic potential.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThe article gives me a better understanding of my research question as I learned to think of potential as a player’s predicted or peak overall rating. This provided me the awesome idea of creating a stacked bar plot of extra potential over current rating to show the range certain players can grow and make a beneficial visualization. The article also provides examinations of examples of certain player’s potential which gives me a better understanding of how I could use this in my project."
