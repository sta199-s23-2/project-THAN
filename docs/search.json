For example, do some teams have player’s with low ratings but a very high potential rating in the future, and do some teams primarily have players with no potential room to grow? Also do certain countries have higher rated players than other countries, or do they have players with a larger amount of potential to improve? I hypothesize that the largest teams like Real Madrid or Barcelona will have players with a higher rating but no significantly greater potential growth. While smaller teams with a developmental academy like Ajax or Lisbon will have players with a lower rating but a higher level of potential growth.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

This will tell us if criticism within the industry and from viewers has actually been effective in making a change in this issue.\nSome other things to explore would be the trends of specific actors/actresses that may have experienced both sides of the age gaps, as well as how this trend exists in movies with multiple couples. As well as looking at whether the male or female member of the couples tends to be older, and whether this trend has shifted over time.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe plan to answer our research question by filtering out the data set so that there are only movies with male and female romantic couples. Then, we will plot the age difference in movies over time via a scatter-plot with all the movies. We can group these movies into different eras to facilitate understanding. Then we can draw a best fit line to see the trend with this odd age-gap as time has elapsed. We predict that the gap will lessen a bit over time due to the criticism of this issue in the movie industry. Based on a first look at the data, one can infer that this hypothesis is true. Some other things to explore would be the trends of specific actors/actresses that may have experienced both sides of the age gaps, and the existence of this trend in movies with multiple couples.\n\n\nResults\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.0.0 ──\n✔ broom        1.0.2     ✔ rsample      1.1.1\n✔ dials        1.1.0     ✔ tune         1.0.1\n✔ infer        1.0.4     ✔ workflows    1.1.2\n✔ modeldata    1.0.1     ✔ workflowsets 1.0.0\n✔ parsnip      1.0.3     ✔ yardstick    1.1.0\n✔ recipes      1.0.3     \n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ scales::discard() masks purrr::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ recipes::fixed()  masks stringr::fixed()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Dig deeper into tidy modeling with R at https://www.tmwr.org\n\nagegaps <- read.csv(file = 'data/age_gaps.csv')\nglimpse(agegaps)\n\nRows: 1,155\nColumns: 13\n$ movie_name         <chr> \"Harold and Maude\", \"Venus\", \"The Quiet American\", …\n$ release_year       <int> 1971, 2006, 2002, 1998, 2010, 1992, 2009, 1999, 199…\n$ director           <chr> \"Hal Ashby\", \"Roger Michell\", \"Phillip Noyce\", \"Joe…\n$ age_difference     <int> 52, 50, 49, 45, 43, 42, 40, 39, 38, 38, 36, 36, 35,…\n$ couple_number      <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ actor_1_name       <chr> \"Ruth Gordon\", \"Peter O'Toole\", \"Michael Caine\", \"D…\n$ actor_2_name       <chr> \"Bud Cort\", \"Jodie Whittaker\", \"Do Thi Hai Yen\", \"T…\n$ character_1_gender <chr> \"woman\", \"man\", \"man\", \"man\", \"man\", \"man\", \"man\", …\n$ character_2_gender <chr> \"man\", \"woman\", \"woman\", \"woman\", \"man\", \"woman\", \"…\n$ actor_1_birthdate  <chr> \"1896-10-30\", \"1932-08-02\", \"1933-03-14\", \"1930-09-…\n$ actor_2_birthdate  <chr> \"1948-03-29\", \"1982-06-03\", \"1982-10-01\", \"1975-11-…\n$ actor_1_age        <int> 75, 74, 69, 68, 81, 59, 62, 69, 57, 77, 59, 56, 65,…\n$ actor_2_age        <int> 23, 24, 20, 23, 38, 17, 22, 30, 19, 39, 23, 20, 30,…\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\nWe predict that overtime the age gaps between couples will lessen due to the criticism of these age gaps within the film industry.\nSince same-sex couples have only begun to be shown in film in the last couple decades, we plan to filter the data set so that it only contains information about movies with heterosexual couples. We will briefly analyze data for same-sex couples towards the end of this report.\nWe will then plot the age difference in movies over time via a scatter-plot with all of the movies. We can then draw a best fit line to see the trend of age-gaps as time has elapsed. We will also color the age differences based on whether the man or woman in the relationship was older. We will then look at individual 25 year eras of films, calculating the true mean age gap found in films produced during the years 1925-1950, 1950-1975, 1975-2000, and 2000-2023. Comparing the confidence intervals produced either by bootstrapping or CLT (based on whether data fits CLT requirements), we can find a better understanding of how age gaps changed between each era.\nFurther, we can preform a hypothesis test to determine whether our hypothesis that age gaps are less today than they were in the past is accurate, finding a p-value to assess our null hypothesis that the mean age gaps today are the same as those in the past.\nWe will also fit a linear regression model to the data, to see how well the year a film was released can predict the age gap found in the film. We will then look at the AIC and AOC of the model to show its strength. can find the r-squared and p-values of these models to show their strength.\n\n\nResults\n\nagegaps <- agegaps |>\n  mutate(age_gap_cat = if_else(age_difference <= 15, \n                               \"Age Gap of 15 Years or Less\",\n                               \"Age Gap Over 15 Years\")) |>\n  mutate(age_gap_cat = fct_relevel(age_gap_cat, c(\"Age Gap Over 15 Years\",\n                                                 \"Age Gap of 15 Years or Less\"))) |>\n  arrange(age_gap_cat)\n\n\nagegaps <- agegaps |>\n  mutate(decades = if_else(release_year >= 1931 & release_year <= 1940, \n                                 \"1930s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1941 & release_year <= 1950, \n                                  \"1940s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1951 & release_year <= 1960, \n                                  \"1950s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1961 & release_year <= 1970, \n                                  \"1960s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1971 & release_year <= 1980, \n                                  \"1970s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1981 & release_year <= 1990, \n                                  \"1980s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1991 & release_year <= 2000, \n                                  \"1990s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 2001 & release_year <= 2010, \n                                  \"2000s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 2011 & release_year <= 2020, \n                                  \"2010s\", \"2020s\"))))))))))\n\nagegaps <- agegaps |>\n  mutate(older_partner = if_else(actor_1_age > actor_2_age & \n                                   character_1_gender == \"man\", \n                                 \"Male\", \"Female\"))\n\n\nHeterosexual Couples\n\n#|label: filter-hetero-samesex\n\nagegaps_hetero <- agegaps |>\n  filter(character_1_gender != character_2_gender)\n\nagegaps_samesex <- agegaps |>\n  filter(character_1_gender == character_2_gender)\n\n\nagegaps_hetero |>\n  filter(age_difference != 0) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = age_difference, color = older_partner)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color = \"#740C9A\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Male\" = \"#21B0FF\", \"Female\" = \"#FF218C\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Age Gaps in Hollywood Films Over the Years\", \n       x = \"Movie Release Year\",\n       y = \"Age Gap In Years\",\n       color = \"Older Partner Gender\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngap_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(age_difference ~ release_year, data = agegaps_hetero)\n\nThe scatter plot above shows every movie observation over time where the couple has an age gap of atleast one year, the x-axis plotting the year the film was released and the y-axis plotting the age gap in years. Each point is shaded either pink, if the older partner was female, or blue, if the older partner was male. The graph shows that the older partner in Hollywood movie relationships is disproportionately male, and that in cases where the older partner is female, the age gap tends to be on the smaller side. In addition, the three best fit lines, purple representing all couples regardless of the gender of the older partner, all show that over time the size of these age gaps has decreased.\n\nagegaps_hetero |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = decades, fill = age_gap_cat)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Age Gap Category\", values = c(\"Age Gap Over 15 Years\" = \"#EB5F5E\",\n                                         \"Age Gap of 15 Years or Less\" = \"#BC5090\")) +\n  labs(title = \"The Decrease of Age Gaps of More Than 15 Years Over Time\",\n       x = \"Decade of Film Release\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Films\")\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above groups movie observations into the decade that they were released. The plot shows that as over time the proportion of films containing age gaps of over 15 years decreases. In the 1940s, over 80% of films had a large age gap of over 15 years. It may be beneficial to note that World War II occurred during most of this decade. This may have caused this period of age gaps of over 15 years because the younger men were off fighting in war rather than acting. Additionally, it is important to recognize how there are not many data points for the 1930s decade as movies were just becoming more prevalent in society during this time period. Now, in the 2020s around 30% of films contain a couple with an age gap of over 15 years.\n\nagegaps_hetero <- agegaps_hetero |>\n  mutate(era = if_else(release_year >= 1930 & release_year < 1950, \n                                 \"pre-1950s\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1951 & release_year < 1975, \n                                  \"1950 to 1975\",\n                          if_else(release_year >= 1975 & release_year < 2000, \n                                  \"1975 to 2000\", \"2000 to 2025\")))) |>\n  mutate(era = fct_relevel(era, c(\"pre-1950s\",\n                                          \"1950 to 1975\",\n                                          \"1975 to 2000\",\n                                          \"2000 to 2025\"))) |>\n  arrange(era)\n\n\nagegaps_hetero |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = era, fill = age_gap_cat)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Age Gap Category\", values = c(\"Age Gap Over 15 Years\" = \"#EB5F5E\",\n                                         \"Age Gap of 15 Years or Less\" = \"#BC5090\")) +\n  labs(title = \"The Decrease of Age Gaps of More Than 15 Years Over 25 Year Periods\",\n       x = \"25 Year Film Release Era\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Films\")\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above simplifies the previous bar chart by combining decades into chunks of 25 years. The plot clearly shows that as over each 25 year period, the proportion of films containing age gaps of over 15 years decreases. From pre-1950, with over 50% of films having large age gaps of over 15 years to 2000-2025 where less than 25% of films contain a couple with an age gap of over 15 years.\n\n\nSame-Sex Couples\n\nonlygaps_samesex <- agegaps_samesex |>\n  filter(age_difference != 0) |>\n  mutate(older_partner = if_else(actor_1_age > actor_2_age & \n                                   character_1_gender == \"man\", \n                                 \"Gay\", \"Lesbian\"))\n\nonlygaps_samesex |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = age_difference, color = older_partner)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color = \"#740C9A\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Gay\" = \"#21B0FF\", \"Lesbian\" = \"#FF218C\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Age Gaps in Hollywood Films Over the Years\", \n       x = \"Movie Release Year\",\n       y = \"Age Gap In Years\",\n       color = \"Relationship Type\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the release dates of Hollywood films become more modern, the age difference between actors whose characters are in relationships decreases.\nAs films become more modern, the proportion of films with age gaps of over 15 years has decreased consistently.\nIt is significantly more common for the older partner in these couples to be male but in cases where the older partner is female, the age gap tends to be less than ten years."
