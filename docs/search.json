While this may be the case in this region, other regions still criminalize HIV exposure and transmission, inhibiting the control of the epidemic and further stigmatizing the disease. In the most recent set of data, over 50% of reporting countries returned data that showed the majority of their younger (15-49 y/o) population still holds discriminatory attitudes towards those with AIDS.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nMy research question aims to look at the regions with high and low rates of discriminatory attitudes and see if, regardless of current levels, globally these trends are decreasing. UNAIDS does not look at the impact of socioeconomic status, age, sex, or education about AIDS in how they categorize their data. I hope that by looking at these factors we can better understand where negative attitudes are originating so as to determine where education would be most necessary and effective in destigmatizing HIV."
