For example, do some teams have player’s with low ratings but a very high potential rating in the future, and do some teams primarily have players with no potential room to grow? Also do certain countries have higher rated players than other countries, or do they have players with a larger amount of potential to improve? I hypothesize that the largest teams like Real Madrid or Barcelona will have players with a higher rating but no significantly greater potential growth. While smaller teams with a developmental academy like Ajax or Lisbon will have players with a lower rating but a higher level of potential growth.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

This will tell us if criticism within the industry and from viewers has actually been effective in making a change on this issue.\nIn addition we will explore whether in cases where an age gap is present if the male or female member of the couple tends to be older.\nSome other things to explore could be the trends of specific actors/actresses that may have experienced both sides of the age gaps, as well as how this trend exists in movies with multiple couples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  older_partner_gender count\n  <chr>                <int>\n1 Female                 215\n2 Male                   917\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  older_partner_gender mean_gap\n  <chr>                   <dbl>\n1 Female                   4.73\n2 Male                    11.7 \n\n\nThe scatter plot above visualizes the age difference between actors in movie relationships over time. The observations are colored based on the gender of the older partner. The purple best fit line shows the trend of age gaps regardless of gender.\nFrom the plot and summary statistics, we observe that in cases where an age gap is present, the older partner tends to be male (215 observations where the older partner was female, 917 where the older partner was male.) And in cases where the older partner is female, the age difference tends to be smaller than the age difference for couples where the older partner is male (mean of 4.73 years compared to 11.7 years respectively.)\nAdditionally, the majority of the observations appear in the last 40 years and there are not many observations from the 1930s and 1940s because the creation of Hollywood movies was just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above groups movie observations into the decade that they were released. The plot shows that the proportion of films containing age gaps of over 15 years decreases over time.\nIn the 1940s, over 80% of films had a large age gap of over 15 years. This proportion could be attributed to World War II, which resulted in younger men enlisting in the military rather than staring in Hollywood films.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot above visualizes the mean age difference in films by the five directors most represented in Hollywood Age Gaps. The plot shows that some directors, like Woody Allen and John Glen, when compared to the mean age difference of heterosexual couples in the dataset (\\(\\mu = 10.4\\)) tend to produce movies with a larger than average age gap; whereas Mike Newell’s movies contain below average sized age gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the data on heterosexual couples, overtime the age gaps shown in films depicting same sex couples has increased."

By comparing the confidence intervals produced either by bootstrapping or CLT (based on whether data fits CLT requirements), we can find a better understanding of how age gaps changed between each era.\nWe will also fit a linear regression model to the data, to see how well the year a film was released can predict the age gap found in the film. We will look at the r-squared of this model to show its strength and analyze the results significance in regards to our hypothesis that as the year becomes more modern age gaps decrease.\nWe will also fit a logistic regression model considering other factors that could help create a more accurate model, including the gender of the older partner, and the director of the film. To test the theory that director could play a role in the age gaps portrayed, we will fit a regression model to the observations from the five most common directors in the data set.\nFurther, we will preform a hypothesis test to determine whether our hypothesis that age gaps are smaller today than they were in the past is accurate, finding a p-value to assess our null hypothesis that the mean age gaps today are the same as those in the past.\n\n\n\nPrediction 2:\nWe predict that the age difference is greater in couples where the older partner is male.\nTo investigate whether the age gap for couples where the older partner is male is greater than the age gap for couples where the older partner is female we will perform a hypothesis test on the difference in mean age differences."

Hollywood Agegap was randomly sampled, meeting the independence requirement.\n\nPre-1950: \\(n = 19 < 30\\)\n1950-1975: \\(n = 87 > 30\\)\n1975-2000: \\(n = 283 > 30\\)\nPost-2000: \\(n = 766 > 30\\)\n\nBased on sample size, we can use CLT for all eras besides pre-1950 films where will use bootstrapping.\n\npre-1950\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower upper\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  12.9  21.1\n\n\nWe can say with 95% confidence that the true mean age gap in pre-1950 films was between 12.9 and 21.1 years.\n\n\n1950-1975\n\n\n[1] 12.32864 16.38400\n\n\nWe can say with 95% confidence that the true mean age gap in films released between 1950 and 1975 was between 12.3 and 16.4 years.\n\n\n1975-2000\n\n\n[1] 13.30298 15.40967\n\n\nWe can say with 95% confidence that the true mean age gap in films released between 1975 and 2000 was between 13.3 and 15.4 years.\n\n\npost-2000\n\n\n[1]  8.901113 10.020558\n\n\nWe can say with 95% confidence that the true mean age gap in films released after 2000 was between 8.9 and 10.0 years.\n\n\nAnalysis of Confidence Intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that over time, the upper bound of the interval has consistently decreased, and the lower bound (besides in the 1975-2000 era) has also decreased, indicating a decrease in the true mean of age gaps over time. This is consistent with what we observed in the scatterplot of age gaps in heterosexual movie couples.\n\n\nLinear Regression Model: Year to Age Difference\n\n\n[1] 0.04524371\n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = age_difference ~ release_year, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n (Intercept)  release_year  \n    231.0808       -0.1103  \n\n\n\\(\\widehat{Age Difference} = 231.0808 - 0.1103 * release\\_year\\)\nOur linear regression model with release year explains roughly 4.5% variation of the variation in age gaps. This shows that there is not a direct correlation between age gap and the year a film was released but does indicate a negative correlation between age difference and year, supporting our hypothesis that the age difference between actors in movie relationships decreases as the release date becomes more modern.\n\n\nLogistic Regression Model: Probability of a Large Age Gap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\widehat{Age Difference} = 231.0808 - 0.1103 * release\\_year\\)\nOur linear regression model with release year explains roughly 4.5% variation of the variation in age gaps. This shows that there is not a direct correlation between age gap and the year a film was released but does indicate a negative correlation between age difference and year, supporting our hypothesis that the age difference between actors in movie relationships decreases as the release date becomes more modern.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing for Difference in Means\nFrom the plot we observe that in cases where the older partner is female, the age difference tends to be less than the age difference for couples where the older partner is male. This is investigated in the following code chunk through hypothesis testing.\nNull Hypothesis: the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is male is the same as the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is female.\n\\(H_o: \\mu_m - \\mu_f = 0\\)\nAlternative Hypothesis: the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is male is greater than the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is female.\n\\(H_o: \\mu_m - \\mu_f > 0\\)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  older_partner_gender mean_age\n  <chr>                   <dbl>\n1 Female                   4.73\n2 Male                    11.7 \n\n\n\\(\\bar{x}_m - \\bar{x}_f = 11.7 - 4.73 = 6.97\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Please be cautious in reporting a p-value of 0. This result is an\napproximation based on the number of `reps` chosen in the `generate()` step. See\n`?get_p_value()` for more information.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1       0\n\n\nWith a \\(p-value < 0.001 > \\alpha = 0.05\\) we decide to reject the null hypothesis that the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is male is the same as the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is female and conclude that there is strong evidence to conclude the alternative hypothesis that the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is male is greater than the true mean age gap for couples where the older partner is female.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the release dates of Hollywood films become more modern, the age difference between actors whose characters are in relationships has decreased.\nAs films become more modern, the proportion of films with age gaps of over 15 years has also consistently decreased.\nIt is significantly more common for the older partner in couples with an age gap to be male."
